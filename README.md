# Mathematics for Machine Learning
This repository includes course material for Linear Algebra, Calculus, and Probability and Statistics. Some of the material acts as a refresher or introduction to more advanced topics in mathematics for machine learning. I have included references to the presentation's content, which I found to be very useful and essential to understanding the key concepts in linear algebra.
